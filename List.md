# Main Items

## Water

The guideline is one liter of water per person per day. I'm packing for two, so I'm going to just keep around 6 gallons of filtered water in the house for this

## Food

I'm going to go with MREs for this, with two boxes (24 meals) being my determined amount to keep. That's both easy to carry and offers more than two weeks of food if necessary.

## Shelter
