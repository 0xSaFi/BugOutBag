# BugOutBag

This project will track the creation of the ideal Bug Out Bag for the
average cautious (but not nutty) person.

It will cover the bag itself as well as the various contents within.

The idea here is to share with others so that they may be prepared as
well, and to enjoy the process of optimizing what the bag contains.
